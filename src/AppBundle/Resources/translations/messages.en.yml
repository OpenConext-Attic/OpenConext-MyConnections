service_orcid_description: |
  <span class="service">ORCID</span> is a nonproprietary alphanumeric code to uniquely identify scientific
  and other academic authors. This addresses the problem that a particular author's contributions to the
  scientific literature or publications in the humanities can be hard to recognize as most personal names
  are not unique, they can change (such as with marriage), have cultural differences in name order,
  contain inconsistent use of first-name abbreviations and employ different writing systems.
